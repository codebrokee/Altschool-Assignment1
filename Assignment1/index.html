      Hi there &#128075 My name is Fadipe Oluwaseun Kelvin. I am a student of the Altschool of Engineering. I specialize
      in Frontend Web Development. My Altschool ID is ALT/SOE/023/2738. 
      I am a graduate of the University of Lagos, where I studied Law. I joined Altschool because I want to further develop my skills in Web Development.
      At the end of the program, I hope to gain a job in the field and someday build something that will be of great benefit to the world.
